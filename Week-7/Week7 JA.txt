1. Difference Between Class and Object
Class

Blueprint or template used to create objects.

Does NOT occupy memory until an object is created.

Contains properties (variables) and methods (functions).

Object

Real-time instance created from a class.

Occupies memory.

Used to access class properties and methods.

Example
class Car {
  brand: string = "Toyota";
  start() {
    console.log("Car started");
  }
}

const car1 = new Car(); // object
console.log(car1.brand);
car1.start();

✅ 2. Access Modifiers in TypeScript

Access modifiers control the visibility of class members.

1. public (default)

Accessible everywhere.

2. private

Accessible only inside the class.

3. protected

Accessible inside class + subclasses (child classes).

Example
class Employee {
  public name: string = "John";
  private salary: number = 50000;
  protected department: string = "IT";

  showSalary() {
    console.log(this.salary); // allowed
  }
}

class Developer extends Employee {
  showDept() {
    console.log(this.department); // allowed because protected
  }
}

const emp = new Employee();
console.log(emp.name); // allowed
// console.log(emp.salary); ❌ Error
// console.log(emp.department); ❌ Error

✅ 3. What is Inheritance in TypeScript?

One class (child) can acquire properties and methods of another class (parent).

Achieved using the extends keyword.

Example
class Animal {
  eat() {
    console.log("Animal is eating");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log("Dog is barking");
  }
}

const d = new Dog();
d.eat();  // inherited
d.bark();

✅ 4. What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism = Many Forms
A single method can behave differently depending on the object calling it.

Types:

Compile-time polymorphism → Method Overloading (not fully supported in TS)

Runtime polymorphism → Method Overriding

Example
class Shape {
  area() {
    console.log("Calculating area...");
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  area() {
    console.log("Area of circle");
  }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  area() {
    console.log("Area of square");
  }
}

const shapes: Shape[] = [new Circle(), new Square()];
shapes.forEach(s => s.area()); // different output for same method

✅ 5. What is Method Overloading?

TypeScript supports method overloading by signature, not by implementation.

Example
class Calculator {
  add(a: number, b: number): number;
  add(a: string, b: string): string;

  add(a: any, b: any): any {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.add(5, 10));      // 15
console.log(calc.add("Hi ", "JS")); // Hi JS

✅ 6. What is Method Overriding?

Child class implements a method with the same name as parent class.

Achieves runtime polymorphism.

Example
class Parent {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello from Parent");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello from Child");
  }
}

const c = new Child();
c.greet(); // Child method overrides parent

✅ 7. What is Abstraction in TypeScript?

Abstraction = Showing essential features and hiding internal details.

Achieved using:

Abstract classes

Interfaces

✅ 8. Abstract Class vs Interface
Abstract Class

Can have:

Abstract methods (no body)

Non-abstract methods (with body)

Supports constructor

Supports access modifiers

Can contain fields (variables)

A class can only extend 1 abstract class

Interface

Only contains method signatures and property definitions.

No implementation.

No constructor.

A class can implement multiple interfaces.

Example: Abstract Class
abstract class Animal {
  abstract sound(): void;  // no body

  sleep() {
    console.log("Sleeping...");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  sound() {
    console.log("Bark");
  }
}

const d = new Dog();
d.sound();
d.sleep();

Example: Interface
interface Vehicle {
  wheels: number;
  start(): void;
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
  wheels = 4;

  start() {
    console.log("Car started");
  }
}

✅ 9. How is this used in classes?

this refers to the current object (instance).

Example:
class Person {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name; // refers to object property
  }

  show() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person("Ram");
p.show(); // Ram

✅ 10. How is super used in classes?

super is used to:

Call parent class constructor

Access parent methods

Example:
class Parent {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  greet() {
    console.log("Hello " + this.name);
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  constructor(name: string) {
    super(name); // calling parent constructor
  }

  greet() {
    super.greet(); // calling parent method
    console.log("Hello from Child");
  }
}

const c = new Child("John");
c.greet();
