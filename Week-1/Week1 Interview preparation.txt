Q1.What is hoisting in JavaScript, and how does it affect Playwright test execution.

Hoisting is JavaScript mechanism where the variable and named function declarations are moved to the top of their 
scope during the compile phase , before the code is executed.

1. Function declaration are fully hoisted.
2. var variables are hoisted but initilized to undefined.
3. let and const variables are hoisted but remain in TDZ Temporal Dead Zone.

1. var

var declarations are hoisted and initialized to undefined.
So, you can access the variable before its declaration (but the value will be undefined until assignment).
Ex:
console.log(a); // ✅ undefined (hoisted + initialized)
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10

2. let

let is hoisted but not initialized.
Exists in a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) from the start of the scope until the line of declaration.
Accessing it before declaration throws a ReferenceError.
Ex
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError (TDZ)
let b = 20;
console.log(b); // 20

3. const

Same as let → hoisted but not initialized, also in Temporal Dead Zone.
The difference: must be initialized at the time of declaration.
Ex:
console.log(c); // ❌ ReferenceError (TDZ)
const c = 30;
console.log(c); // 30

Q2. What is the difference between var, let, and const in terms of scoping and hoisting.

var is function scoped and hoisted with undefined.
let and const are block scoped but not initilized(temporal dead zone).

Q3. What is Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript?
TDZ is a phase between entering a scope and the actual declaration where accesing a let and const throws reference error.


Q4. How does trim() improve reliability in form input automation?

trim() is a JavaScript string method used to remove whitespace from both the beginning and the end of a string.

const name = " Ravi "
const trimmedName = name.trim()

Related methods

trimStart() → removes only from the start

trimEnd() → removes only from the end

Q5. When would you use replaceAll() in test Automation?

Syntax
string.replaceAll(searchValue, replaceValue)

searchValue → The substring or regex you want to replace.

replaceValue → The string (or function) you want to replace it with.

const text = "Playwright is fast. Playwright is reliable.";
const newText = text.replaceAll("Playwright", "Selenium");

console.log(newText);

Q6.What is the differen between == and === in JavScript ? Give example where == returns true but === returns false?

'5'==5; //true ('5' of datatype string is coerced to number datatype 5 )//
Automatic conversion of values from one data type to another
JavaScript is a loosely typed (dynamic) language,
'5'===5;//false (string!=number)

0==false; //true ( type coercion : false becomes 0)
0===false; // false (number!=boolean)

Q7. How replace() works?

The replace() method in JavaScript is used to return a new string with the first occurrence of a substring or pattern replaced by another string.

Syntax
string.replace(searchValue, replaceValue)


searchValue → The text or regex to find.

replaceValue → The text (or function) to replace it with.
Example 1: Replace a word (string)
const text = "I love JavaScript. JavaScript is great!";
const newText = text.replace("JavaScript", "Python");

console.log(newText);
// Output: "I love Python. JavaScript is great!"

Q8. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var: function-scoped, hoisted (initialized as undefined), allows re-declaration.
let: block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone), can be reassigned but not re-declared.
const: block-scoped, must be initialized at declaration, cannot be reassigned.
var: redeclare ✅, reassign ✅
let: redeclare ❌, reassign ✅
const: redeclare ❌, reassign ❌

Q9. What is difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive?

Primitive types:

Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, BigInt, Symbol
It is Stored directly in memory, immutable (e.g., let x = 5).

Non-Primitive types: Object (includes arrays, functions etc.)
It is Stored as references, mutable (e.g., arrays, objects)

Q10: Expalin the history behind JS naming convention?

JS was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in just 10 days, It's first name was Mocha.
Before the official launch, Netscape temporarily renamed it as Livescript(Beta release)
Finally as part of marketing deal with Netscape and Sun Microsystem. It was renamed as JavaScript to align with Java’s popularity at
the time, even though it is not directly related to Java

Early JS History

1995: Brendan Eich created the first version of JS in just 10 days at Netscape.

Initially called Mocha, then renamed LiveScript.

🔹 Where Sun Microsystems Comes In

At that time, Sun Microsystems owned the Java programming language.

Java was very popular and marketed as the “write once, run anywhere” language.

Netscape wanted to ride on that popularity for their new scripting language.

So, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems in a marketing deal:

They licensed the Java trademark from Sun.

Renamed LiveScript → JavaScript in December 1995.

This was purely a branding/marketing move, not a technical one.
👉 JavaScript and Java are completely different languages.

🔹 Aftermath

1996: Microsoft made its own version called JScript (for Internet Explorer).

To avoid fragmentation, ECMA International standardized JavaScript as ECMAScript in 1997.

✅ So Sun Microsystems’ role was:
They owned Java and allowed Netscape to use the Java brand name for “JavaScript” as part of a business/marketing strategy.

European computer manufacturers association,in order to ensure browser compatibility the standard was framed by ECMA and its first version 
Ecmascript1 was released in 1997.

Q11. What is the difference between null and undefined?

undefined → variable declared but not assigned a value.
Var accountNumber=undefined

null → intentional absence of value assigned by the programmer.
Var LandlineNumber=Null

Example 1: undefined
let a;
console.log(a);        // undefined (no value assigned)

function test(x) {
  console.log(x);
}
test();                // undefined (argument not passed)

🔹 Example 2: null
let b = null;
console.log(b);        // null (explicitly assigned)

let person = { name: "John", age: null };
console.log(person.age); // null → meaning "no age specified"
