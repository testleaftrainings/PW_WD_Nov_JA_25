1.What are the different types of functions in JavaScript?
1. Function Declaration/ Named Function
-----------------------------------------

function greet() {

}
greet()

2. Function Expression
-----------------------

const greet = function() {};

greet()

3. Arrow Function
------------------

const greet = () => {};

()

4.Call Back:

function checkAvailability (movieName, callback){

console.log(`Checking the movie name`);

setTimeout( () => {

   // movieName="Lord of rings"
    console.log("Movie "+movieName+ "is available");
    callback();  
    
}, 2000);

}
function playMovie(){
console.log(`Now playing the movie`);
}

checkAvailability("Spider Man",playMovie )

2. Explain about promise and different stages in Java script.

let zeptoDelivery = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  let isDelivered = true; // Change to false to test rejection

    if (isDelivered) {
      resolve("✅ Zepto delivered your groceries in 10 minutes!");
    } else {
      reject("❌ Zepto failed to deliver. Please try again.");
    }

});

zeptoDelivery
  .then((message) => {
    console.log(message); // When delivered successfully
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error); // When delivery fails
  });

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual **completion (or failure)** of an **asynchronous operation** and its resulting value.

1. Pending
The moment you write:

let zeptoDelivery = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... });
The Promise is in the pending state.

The JavaScript engine is waiting to see if the grocery delivery succeeds (resolve) or fails (reject).

2. Fulfilled (Resolved)
If isDelivered = true, then:


resolve("✅ Zepto delivered your groceries in 10 minutes!");
The Promise moves from pending → fulfilled.

.then() gets triggered, printing:


✅ Zepto delivered your groceries in 10 minutes!
3. Rejected
If isDelivered = false, then:


reject("❌ Zepto failed to deliver. Please try again.");
The Promise moves from pending → rejected.

.catch() gets triggered, printing:


❌ Zepto failed to deliver. Please try again.

* async/await was introduced in **ES2017**.

3. What protocol is used in Playwright?**

**Answer:**
Playwright uses the **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** and also supports its own **WebSocket-based protocol** to communicate with browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

follow up question --> what is websocket protocol?

📌 Answer:
WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex (two-way) communication between a client (browser) and a server over a single TCP connection.

🔍 Key Points (for Interviews):
Unlike HTTP (which is request-response and one-way), WebSockets allow real-time, two-way communication.

Ideal for apps like chat, live notifications, stock updates, or collaborative tools.

WebSocket connections remain open, unlike HTTP which closes after each request.

✅ Real-life Example:
In Playwright, when you launch a browser, it communicates with the test runner using WebSocket, allowing commands to be sent and events to be received live.

4. What is Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)?**

**Answer:**
CDP is a low-level protocol used by tools (like Playwright, Puppeteer) to control, inspect, and debug Chromium-based browsers.
It allows direct access to browser internals like **DOM**, **network**, **console**, etc.

5. what is Browser Installation Command — npx or npm?**

**Answer:**

* **Install Playwright with browsers:**

 
  npx playwright install

* This installs Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
* To install Playwright package:

  npm install -D @playwright/test

6. Different Browsers Supported by Playwright**

**Answer:**
Playwright supports:

* **Chromium** (Chrome, Edge)
* **Firefox**
* **WebKit** (Safari engine)

It allows **cross-browser testing** with a single codebase.

7.Explain  About Chromium Browser**

**Answer:**
Chromium is an **open-source browser** developed by Google.
Playwright uses it for **fast**, **headless** testing and full browser control.
It is the base for **Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge**.

8. What is the `test` function in Playwright?**

**Answer:**
The `test()` function is provided by the `@playwright/test` module is a test runner.
It defines a **test case**.


test('verify login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
});

Used with fixtures like `page`, `browser`, etc.

9. Explain about `async/await`**

**Answer:**
`async/await` is a cleaner way to handle Promises in JavaScript.

* `async` keyword defines a function that returns a Promise.
* `await` pauses execution until the Promise is resolved or rejected.


async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  console.log(response);
}

Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code.

10.How does Playwright handle auto-waiting and retries?

Playwright auto-waits for elements to become visible, enabled, and attached to the DOM.

It also retries failed steps (like click or fill) until timeout is hit, reducing flakiness.

11 .What is the role of Browser, Context, and Page in Playwright?

Browser: Actual browser engine (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

Context: Isolated environment like an incognito session

Page: A single tab within a context

Use Case: Parallel tests using multiple contexts or pages.
